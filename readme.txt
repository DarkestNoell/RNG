Greetings.

	Thank you very much for allowing me to implement my robot quiz on your website. I'm excited to help you deploy this. 
	
	As I don't know how your template is set up for wordpress, I have just a few things to note:
	ALL of the code can be found in the index.html file, including the css, javascript/jquery, and bootstrap code. However, if you prefer seperate code, 
	I have seperated the css and js files, depending on how you wish to implement the quiz.
	
	These are all the tags in the <head> tags, please use these as necessary:
		 <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm" crossorigin="anonymous">
         <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
         <meta property="og:url"           content="https://www.your-domain.com/your-page.html" />
         <meta property="og:type"          content="website" />
         <meta property="og:title"         content="Your Website Title" />
         <meta property="og:description"   content="Your description" />
         <meta property="og:image"         content="https://www.your-domain.com/path/image.jpg" />
		 
	If you do NOT have a bootstrap plugin, could you please include it?
		
	Please be sure to update any asset paths depending on your folder structure. Also, please update the link to the wordpress page for the Facebook 
	and Twitter buttons so that users can go directly to the quiz page. Currently the link is set to the previous blog post you made about the 
	Robots and Gods book. 
	
	I know there is a bit of shifting around to do, and I appreciate your patience with this matter. Please let me know if I can update anything 
	on my end to make your implementation easier.
